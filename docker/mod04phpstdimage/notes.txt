docker run -d --rm -v%cd%:/var/www/html -p8085:80 --name toto php:apache

-d 	detached - runs in the background (not sure why this is not the default)
--rm 	container will be deleted when it stops
-v	volumes - it mounts a volume from the host into the container (it's a "live wire", the container will impact the host folder directly)
-p	ports - port in the host (8085) that will map to a port in the container (80)
--name	name the instance (in addition to the hash code that it always receives)
