* GRADLE - part 1 - intro

right side

** Why
*** Mix of adaptability and convention
***_ Declarative is considered the better solution (Maven)
***_ Declarative is also limited
***_ Gradle seeks a balance, pending to convention

** Pros
*** You have the **choice** to be imperative when you need
***_ JVM based
***_ Uses common languages (Groovy, Kotlin)
***_ Latest versions are very fast
** Cons
*** When there can be code, there is code
**** aa.com build.gradle was a nightmare
***_ Declarative means follow a contract. XML is better

** Caveats
*** Balance is fine, but builds should be dumb simple
***_ If your build is too complicated, there's something wrong
***_ Don't try to create a pipeline with Gradle, although you could
